    "#### Thermoset resins, like epoxy, cure via chemical reactions. These reactions lead to covalent bonds being formed between monomers, forming the polymer. This process of curing is described as the degree of cure $\\alpha$. Before any covalent bond is formed, the material exists solely out of monomers. In this case, it can be said that no convergence has happened and thus $\\alpha = 0$. After adding hardener, the bonding of these monomers begins to form polymer chains. Once all monomers are attached to a polymer chain, via the mentioned covalent bonds, it can be said that the degree of cure $\\alpha = 1$.\n",

    "#### Chemical reactions occur through contact of two reactants. If these two reactants have more kinetic energy, they vibrate more. Then, it can be assumed that the number of collisions between two neighboring reactents will increase as well. Since temperature is movement on the microscale, an increase in temperature will have an effect on the curing of the thermoset. Also, when more time is given to two reactants, the probability of a necessary collision for bonding increases.\n",

    "#### Cure kinetics is concerned with the rates of the chemical reactions in a curing process. This is important, since the cure kinetics can help predict the thermoset cure and therefore also determines the manufacturing process and (partially) the final material properties. When cure kinetics are understood, they can be used to predict the degree of cure $\\alpha$ of a certain process. To make a prediction like this, DSC measurement data can be used. The DSC process is explained in the lecture."

    "#### As adressed at the start of this Notebook, thermoset polymers need to undergo a curing cycle to harden. During this curing cycle, covalent bonds are formed between monomers, forming the polymers. When not many bonds (crosslinks) have formed, the glass transition temperature of the material is relatively low. Once bonds form, the glass transition temperature increases. This can be indirectly observed by noticing that there is a change in state of a thermoset resin during the curing cycle."
