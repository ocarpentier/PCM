    "$\\alpha$ (degree of cure ) increases with the progression of the curing process. In thermosets , viscosity is lower at the beginning of curing, as soon as the hardener and resin are mixed together , the conversion process begins and when the threshhold degree of cure is reached(gel time) ,there is a rapid increase in the formation of crosslinks, which causes the polymer to flow slower (increased resistance to flow or viscosity),transforming from a liquid state to a gel state and continues to cure and harden as the viscosity approaches infinity.\n",
    "As viscosity is a function of $\\alpha$, it increases as viscosity increases and crosslinks form. The thermoset polymer should possess appropriate gel time so as to accomodate the wetting of the fiber at low viscosities and uniform spread of polymer before the gel time is met. This is important to keep in mind to produce high quality parts using liquid composite molding techniques.If viscosity of the resin increases too fast(gel time occurs fast), the flow of resin will be highly constrained resulting in voids, poor adhesion between the layers, uneven distribution of resin causing dry spots and increased risk of delamination and reduced overall strength of composite.\n"
